# harry_potter_nlp
Final research for SDS3386.

## Project Intentions

Conduct exploration and experimentation on the harry potter data package, using word embedding techniques.

- [] Read the word embedding tutorial again to determine if I can find word association for character names in the HP books
- [] Check the Harry Potter package for R, find suitable resources for data munging
